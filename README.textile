h1. Morphological Analysis Plugin for ElasticSearch

The Morphological Analysis plugin integrates <a href="https://github.com/AKuznetsov/russianmorphology">Russian and English morphology for java and lucene framework</a> into elasticsearch. This plugin adds two new analyzers: "russian_morphology" and "english_morphology" and two token filters with the same names.

The <a href="https://github.com/imotov/elasticsearch-analysis-morphology/blob/master/demo.sh">demo.sh</a> file shows a few examples of the analyzers behavior.
